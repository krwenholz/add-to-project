# actions/add-to-project

Use this action to automatically add the current issue or pull request to a GitHub project.
Note that this is for [GitHub projects
(beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects),
not the original GitHub projects.

## Current Status

[![build-test](https://github.com/actions/add-to-project/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actions/add-to-project/actions/workflows/test.yml)

ðŸš¨ **This action is in beta, however the API is stable. Some breaking changes might occur between versions, but it is not likely to break as long as you use a specific SHA or version number** ðŸš¨

> **NOTE:** This Action (currently) only supports auto-adding Issues to a Project which lives in the same organization as your target Repository.

## Usage

_See [action.yml](action.yml) for [metadata](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions) that defines the inputs, outputs, and runs configuration for this action._

_For more information about workflows, see [Using workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows)._

Create a workflow that runs when Issues or Pull Requests are opened, labeled, or assigned in your repository; this workflow also supports adding Issues to your project which are transferred into your repository. Optionally configure any filters you may want to add, such as only adding issues with certain labels, you may match labels and assignees with an `AND` or an `OR` operator.

Once you've configured your workflow, save it as a `.yml` file in your target Repository's `.github/workflows` directory.

##### Example Usage: Issue opened with labels `bug` OR `needs-triage`

```yaml
name: Add bugs to bugs project

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened

jobs:
  add-to-project:
    name: Add issue to project
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@main
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/orgs/<orgName>/projects/<projectNumber>
          github-token: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT }}
          labeled: bug, needs-triage
          label-operator: OR
```

##### Example Usage: Pull Requests labeled with `needs-review` and `size/XL`

```yaml
name: Add needs-review and size/XL pull requests to projects

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - labeled

jobs:
  add-to-project:
    name: Add issue to project
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@main
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/orgs/<orgName>/projects/<projectNumber>
          github-token: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT }}
          labeled: needs-review, size/XL
          label-operator: AND
```

## Inputs

- <a name="project-url">`project-url`</a> **(required)** is the URL of the GitHub project to add issues to.  
  _eg: `https://github.com/orgs|users/<ownerName>/projects/<projectNumber>`_
- <a name="github-token">`github-token`</a> **(required)** is a [personal access
  token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `repo`, `write:org` and
  `read:org` scopes.  
  _See [Creating a PAT and adding it to your repository](#creating-a-pat-and-adding-it-to-your-repository) for more details_
- <a name="labeled">`labeled`</a> **(optional)** is a comma-separated list of labels used to filter applicable issues. When this key is provided, an issue must have _one_ of the labels in the list to be added to the project. Omitting this key means that any issue will be added.
- <a name="label-operator">`label-operator`</a> **(optional)** is the behavior of the labels filter, either `AND` or `OR` that controls if the issue should be matched with `all` `labeled` input or any of them, default is `OR`.
- <a name="assigned">`assigned`</a> **(optional)** is a comma-separated list of assignees used to filter applicable issues. When this key is provided, an issue must have _one_ of the assignees in the list to be added to the project. Omitting this key means that any issue will be added.
- <a name="assignee-operator">`assignee-operator`</a> **(optional)** is the behavior of the assigned filter, either `AND` or `OR` that controls if the issue should be matched with `all` `assigned` input or any of them, default is `OR`.

## Supported Events

Currently this action supports the following [`issues` events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues):

- `opened`
- `transferred`
- `labeled`
- `assigned`

and the following [`pull_request` events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request):

- `opened`
- `labeled`
- `assigned`

Using these events ensure that a given issue or pull request, in the workflow's repo, is added to the [specified project](#project-url). If [labeled input(s)](#labeled) are defined, then issues will only be added if they contain at least _one_ of the labels in the list.

## How to point the action to a specific branch or commit sha

Pointing to a branch name generally isn't the safest way to refer to an action, but this is how you can use this action now before we've begun creating releases.

```yaml
jobs:
  add-to-project:
    name: Add issue to project
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@main
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/orgs/<orgName>/projects/<projectNumber>
          github-token: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT }}
```

Another option would be to point to a full [commit SHA](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#commit):

```yaml
jobs:
  add-to-project:
    name: Add issue to project
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@<commitSHA>
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/orgs/<orgName>/projects/<projectNumber>
          github-token: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT }}
```

## Creating a PAT and adding it to your repository

- create a new [personal access
  token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `repo`, `write:org` and
  `read:org` scopes  
  _See [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for more information_

- add the newly created PAT as a repository secret, this secret will be referenced by the [github-token input](#github-token)  
  _See [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for more information_

## Development

To get started contributing to this project, clone it and install dependencies.
Note that this action runs in Node.js 16.x, so we recommend using that version
of Node (see "engines" in this action's package.json for details).

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/actions/add-to-project
> cd add-to-project
> npm install
```

Or, use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

See the [toolkit
documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages)
for the various packages used in building this action.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repositories, so we check in the packaged action in
the "dist/" directory.

```shell
> npm run build
> git add lib dist
> git commit -a -m "Build and package"
> git push origin releases/v1
```

Now, a release can be created from the branch containing the built action.
